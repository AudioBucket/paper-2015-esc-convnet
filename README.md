#### Environmental Sound Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks - paper replication data

---

**Abstract:**

> This paper evaluates the potential of convolutional neural networks in classifying short audio clips of environmental sounds. A deep model consisting of 2 convolutional layers with max-pooling and 2 fully connected layers is trained on a low level representation of audio data (segmented spectrograms) with deltas. The accuracy of the network is evaluated on 3 public datasets of environmental and urban recordings. The model outperforms baseline implementations relying on mel-frequency cepstral coefficients and achieves results comparable to other state-of-the-art approaches.
